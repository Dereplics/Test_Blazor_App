# Test_Blazor_App
This document briefly explains how the web app works.
This is a simple web to-do list that:
1. Takes user input 
2. Add it to a list of non-existing task.
3. Displays a warning error if a task already exists.
4. And we can also delete a task.
# Note: This is just a test app there will be improvements subsequently. Thank you for testing our app.
